<p>This is my favourite movie by Ghibli Studio.<br />
I like it because it's an emotional watch, follows a great storyline and the plot twist is unexpected and heart warming.<br />

<p>This is an absolute comfort watch trilogy.<br />
I personally love the second movie since it carries so much emotion. There are various moments where you're rooting for the main character -Hiccup and his dragon Toothless, to win and persevere.<br />

<p>This is an Anime adaptation of a Manga with the same name.<br />
It's a horror Anime combined with themes of Slice of Life following the story of two childhood friends who navigate their life around an unfortunate event where one of them- Hikaru, dies and comes back as a demonic entity.<br />
The show is fairly new to Netflix and can be watched there as of the year 2025.<br />
